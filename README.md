# EDA-Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Data

Project Summary -
This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to uncover key trends and factors that influence hotel bookings. The dataset contains information on bookings for both city hotels and resort hotels, including details such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests (adults, children, and babies), and the availability of amenities like parking spaces.

The analysis will focus on identifying patterns and trends, such as the best time of year to book a hotel room, the optimal length of stay for the best daily rate, and factors that may contribute to a higher number of special requests. By leveraging this data, the project will provide insights into customer behavior and preferences, helping hotels optimize their offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue.

The outcome of the project will offer actionable recommendations for hotel managers and stakeholders to enhance their pricing strategies, inventory management, and customer service.
